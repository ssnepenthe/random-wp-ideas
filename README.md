# random-wp-ideas

Just a central repository where I can collect some random ideas for WordPress as they pop into my head.

## dump-server

A (rough) integration of the Symfony VarDumper dump server for non-framework sites. This is not a WP specific tool but could potentially be updated to include WP-specific context data and/or be reworked to run within WP-CLI.
